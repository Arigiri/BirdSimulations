# Weather Utilities Module

## Overview

The Utilities module provides supporting tools and utilities for building, configuring, and debugging the weather simulation system.

## Components

### Build Utilities (`build_cpp_module.py`)

Tools for compiling and building the C++ backend:
- Automated build process for C++ extensions
- Cross-platform compatibility support
- Configuration options for different build targets

### Debug Tools

Diagnostic and debugging tools for:
- Verifying correct installation and configuration
- Inspecting simulation state
- Troubleshooting integration issues

## Usage

### Building the C++ Module

```python
# From the project root directory
python -m model.weather.python.utils.build_cpp_module
```

### Debug Checklist

The module includes a checklist for verifying the simulation environment:
- C++ extension availability
- Required dependencies
- System compatibility
- Performance benchmarking

## Configuration

The build system supports configuration options through:
- Environment variables for compiler selection
- Build flags for optimization levels
- Platform-specific settings

## Dependencies

The utilities depend on:
- Python build tools (setuptools, wheel)
- C++ compiler compatible with pybind11
- NumPy for array interfaces

For Windows users, the module includes pre-compiled binaries with their dependencies.
