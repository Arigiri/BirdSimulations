# Weather Performance Module

## Overview

The Performance module provides optimized implementations of weather simulation algorithms, focusing on computational efficiency and parallel processing capabilities for handling large-scale simulations.

## Components

### Optimized Logic (`logic_optimized.py`)

Optimized numerical algorithms for weather simulation:
- Vectorized operations using NumPy
- Memory-efficient data structures
- Improved mathematical formulations for stability

### Multiprocessing Support (`weather_multiprocessing.py`)

Parallel processing capabilities for:
- Distributing workload across CPU cores
- Domain decomposition for large simulations
- Optimized data transfer between processes

### Fixed Simulation (`simulation_fixed.py`)

Enhanced simulation engine with:
- Fixed time stepping mechanisms
- Boundary condition handling
- Stability improvements for long-running simulations

## Usage

```python
from model.weather.python.performance import ParallelWeatherSimulation
import numpy as np

# Initialize parallel simulation
sim = ParallelWeatherSimulation(width=400, height=400, num_processes=4)

# Set initial conditions
sim.set_temperature_gradient(min_temp=10.0, max_temp=30.0, direction="NORTH_SOUTH")
sim.generate_wind_field(method="perlin", scale=10.0, octaves=4)

# Run simulation with parallel processing
sim.run_parallel(num_steps=1000)

# Get results
temperature = sim.get_temperature()
wind_x, wind_y = sim.get_wind_field()
```

## Performance Comparison

The optimized implementations provide significant performance improvements:
- Up to 8x speedup with vectorized operations
- Near-linear scaling with number of CPU cores for parallelized code
- Reduced memory footprint for large simulations

## Integration

These performance modules can be used as drop-in replacements for the core simulation engine when handling larger datasets or requiring faster execution.
