## Notes

- Aim to complete each phase before moving to the next
- Regularly test performance with increasing numbers of birds
- Document decisions, optimizations, and lessons learned
- Keep code modular to allow easy changes to algorithms
- Consider future extensions but focus on completing core functionality first
